skill_lib.py — shared helpers for the Revenue-Centric Design skill updater.

The skill is SELF-DESCRIBING: the set of included posts, the coverage date range,
and the per-theme principle counts are all derived from references/*.md — there is
no separate manifest to drift out of sync. Post dates come from the tweet ID itself
(Twitter Snowflake), so computing coverage needs zero API calls.

Stdlib only.
