# AI-Era Differentiation & Moats

> Curated, distilled wisdom from @richardrx ("Richard — Design for startups"), translated from Portuguese. Each entry is a reusable principle linked to its source post.

## Faster building doesn't fix churn — activation does
**Principle.** Build speed was never the bottleneck. Shipping the same confusing interface faster is just a more efficient route to churn. The real gap is the space between a user entering the product and understanding what to do.
**Apply when.** Vibe coding is sold to a founder as "the product got cheaper to build," and the team equates speed with progress.
**The move.** Obsess over activation, not velocity. Attack the three things vibe coding never touches: onboarding, attention hierarchy, and value delivery in the first sessions (TTV). More products now compete for the same user attention, so close the entry-to-understanding gap.
**Voice.** "Build speed without an obsession for activation is just a more efficient way to reach churn."

## Same engine, different UX: don't compete on the commodity
**Principle.** AI turned your codebase into a near-commodity — under the hood ~90% of new tools call the same APIs. Engineering solves the base function; design and packaging are what differentiate and resist copying.
**Apply when.** Your "engine" is effectively identical to a competitor's and a generic interface is pulling you into a price war.
**The move.** Win on UX architecture, not the engine. Superior UX (1) removes initial friction → lifts conversion; (2) fits the user's workflow → cuts churn, raises LTV; (3) eases continuous/collaborative use → enables upsell. This builds a differentiator that lowers copy risk and keeps the customer paying.
**Evidence.** VW Up, Seat Mii, and Skoda Citigo share the exact same platform — chassis, drivetrain, and the identical EA211 engine — yet are designed and packaged for different ICPs (young, pragmatic-utility, reliability).
**Voice.** "The engine may be identical, but it's the architecture of the user experience that builds your moat."

## A validated idea is a short-term game — plan the moat
**Principle.** If your only advantage is the codebase, you've merely built a validated MVP for better-funded competitors to execute. Structural barriers to entry (the moat) are planned, never accidental.
**Apply when.** Your tech is easy to replicate and the product identity is generic — clones can ship within days.
**The move.** Plan three deliberate moats: (1) Brand Power — a proprietary visual identity with above-average UX signals less risk and sells perceived safety (conversion); (2) Switching cost via UX — intuitive flows users have internalized make moving to a 20%-cheaper clone costly in productivity (retention); (3) Expansion architecture — internal network effects (invite-to-collaborate) are harder to copy and pull in new users (LTV). Users who perceive a value ecosystem prefer paying more over adapting to a worse, cheaper product.
**Evidence.** The "Roast My Startup" tool was cloned within a week — copies flooded the timeline — proving a codebase-only edge is no defense.
**Voice.** "Clones can't copy trust."

## Design for shrinking attention spans
**Principle.** Short-form video acts on the brain like a variable-reward slot machine, switching off the attention filter and eroding self-control — leaving users with high anxiety and low focus. If your user's attention keeps shrinking, design must be militarily focused.
**Apply when.** Building any product whose users are conditioned by infinite short-video feeds (attention economy).
**The move.** Engineer for the attention limit: (1) drastically reduce cognitive load; (2) direct absolutely toward the target task (conversion); (3) build interfaces that respect the human attention ceiling.
**Evidence.** An EEG study (Fabiano et al., Frontiers in Human Neuroscience) links short-form-video addiction to reduced frontal-lobe activity and weakened ability to focus.
**Voice.** "TikTok is the hot dog of social media — hyper-palatable, but nutrient-poor: you consume endlessly and it never nourishes you."

## Sell the value, not the feature list — and show the product
**Principle.** AI auto-generates landing pages, but ~90% share the same defects. A generic, inconsistent hero is what loses visitors, not the absence of fancy design.
**Apply when.** Auditing an AI-generated LP that leans on features and trendy gradients instead of the user's pain.
**The move.** Fix the three recurring failures: (1) generic, inconsistent aesthetics (every component a different color, purple/green gradients on dark/white); (2) over-indexing on features instead of the value/pain they address; (3) barely showing the actual product. Build the hero to pass the 5-second test — what does this do, why care, what next.
**Visual.** Supafast's "SaaS Hero Section Formula" — 5 elements with before/after copy: Headline (≤8 words, attack the #1 pain), Subheadline (show the transformation), Primary CTA (specific to outcome), Secondary CTA (low-commitment), Trust Bar (5 logos or one specific number) — `../assets/2025246347587162602__q__1.jpg`

## Don't let AI-to-Figma-to-code factory technical debt
**Principle.** A Claude → Figma → Code flow looks like speed but creates two documents that drift out of sync, plus inconsistent components — a maintenance Frankenstein, not velocity.
**Apply when.** A tool promises round-tripping AI output through the design canvas into code as a shortcut.
**The move.** Refuse the false shortcut. Without a design system and context, generated components are superficially similar but fundamentally inconsistent (random button padding, off-brand colors, inconsistent UX patterns). Manual tweaks don't flow back to code, so the source of truth reverts to the canvas and the two files desync. For devs it's useless (V0/Lovable already emit code without the full-seat toll); for designers it's a distraction that skips information architecture to spit out a screen fast.
**Voice.** "A technical-debt factory."

## Beat the four AI failure modes that make a vibe-coded SaaS feel like a fraud
**Principle.** When the barrier to entry tends to zero, competition tends to infinity. AI lowered that barrier and amplified Dunning-Kruger — you feel omniscient but lack the base to judge if its output is a solution or wasted time. You shipped code, not a seductive product, and you're diving into a red ocean. Code is no longer the asset — just one ingredient.
**Apply when.** A "complete SaaS in a weekend" is validated but feels hollow, generic, and clonable by Wednesday.
**The move.** Fix the four pillars where AI fails: (1) **Generic-product trap** — AI is trained on the internet's average, and average builds nothing extraordinary; escape commoditization by building the only possible tool for an ignored niche (not "CRM for doctors" but "CRM for facial-harmonization clinics" with a `last_toxin_date` field and a 110-day retouch-alert cron). (2) **Value delivery / TTV** — don't ship login → empty dashboard (the 99% default); build an on-ramp to value, an onboarding assistant, not a desert. (3) **Trust / visual confidence** — in a sea of V0/Tailwind templates, aesthetics, personality, and consistency are the last remaining trust proxies; intentional, human-aligned pixels signal authority, build trust, and lower CAC. (4) **Human touch** — cheaper code should buy more time for the memorable details (kind error messages, a 404 that returns the user, business logic that anticipates mistakes, a 200ms confirming micro-interaction) — humans are predictably irrational, full of bias.
**Evidence.** Johnson & Goldstein (2003), *Science* — a mere "opt-out" default produced +90% organ-donation consent, proving small design choices move behavior.
**Visual.** The Dunning-Kruger curve — confidence spikes at "Ignorant" (low knowledge), craters at "Cultured," and climbs toward "Expert," with a labeled "confidence gap" — `../assets/2013264068518289753__2.jpg`
**Voice.** "You can own all the cement in the world, but without the blueprint and structural engineering you're just a pile of gray concrete."
