> A distilled, English-language playbook for designing SaaS & startup products that **convert, retain, and monetize** — packaged as an [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io) for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Gemini, and any [skills.sh](https://skills.sh)-compatible agent.

**101 principles** distilled from the X/Twitter writing of **Richard ([@richardrx](https://x.com/richardrx))** — a product designer specializing in conversion-rate optimization, churn reduction, and applied behavioral science (**ex-Volkswagen, ex-PayPal, ex-IBM**). The throughline is his coined philosophy, **Revenue-Centric Design (RCD)**: design should serve the user _and_ the business — value and revenue, not one or the other.

> **Last updated:** 1 July 2026
> **Coverage:** @richardrx's curated posts from **14 Jan 2026 → 1 Jul 2026** (101 posts). Anything posted after this date is not yet included — see [Updating](#updating).

## Install

```bash
npx skills add heliocosta-dev/revenue-centric-design
```

This pulls the skill into your agent's skills directory (`.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, …) and works with any Agent Skills–compatible agent.

**Already installed it?** Pull the latest version with `npx skills update revenue-centric-design` (or a bare `npx skills update` to refresh every installed skill). The command re-fetches from GitHub; your agent picks up the new content on its next session.

Or install it manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heliocosta-dev/revenue-centric-design.git ~/.claude/skills/revenue-centric-design
```

## ⚠️ Usage boundary

> 🚫 **Not for betting, casino, or gambling products.** The author granted permission to reuse this material on the explicit condition that it is **never used for gambling/betting/casino work** (including loot-box / real-money-gaming mechanics). The skill instructs agents to decline such requests. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## What's inside

The skill loads only the theme relevant to your question (progressive disclosure). Each principle follows a fixed shape — **Principle → Apply when → The move → Evidence → Visual → Source** — so your agent gets the _named lever_ (decoy effect, Swiss Knife Index, GBB, Eugene Schwartz's awareness levels, loss aversion, peak-end rule…), the concrete action, and the proof.

## The spine: RCD in 9 principles

1. **Neutrality is omission** — an interface that doesn't direct hurts conversion.
2. **Who talks to everyone convinces no one** — no ICP → generic value → worse retention.
3. **Value first, ask later** — proof must arrive before the user questions their choice.
4. **Your promise is the size of your proof** — the market believes what you demonstrate, not what you claim.
5. **Same competes on price, different on category** — no contrast, no margin.
6. **Default is the decision you made for the user** — the initial state defines mass behavior.
7. **Retention is built, not requested** — perceived loss retains more than promised benefit.
8. **Expansion is born of usage** — upgrade at the moment of the limit, never by interruption.
9. **Price is a filter** — pricing defines who enters, who stays, and who expands.

## Updating

This is a point-in-time snapshot. The **Coverage** date above marks the latest included post (**1 Jul 2026**); anything newer from [@richardrx](https://x.com/richardrx) isn't here yet. To extend it: gather the newer posts, distill each into the same principle shape, file it under the right `references/` theme, then bump the dates in this README and in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
